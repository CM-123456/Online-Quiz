                        <p>World record The largest quiz, according to Guinness, was the "Quiz for Life", held at the Flanders Expo Halls in Ghent, Belgium, on 11 December 2010 with 2,280 participants.The winning team Caf√© De Kastaar from Leuven consisted of Marnix Baes, Erik Derycke, Eric Hemelaers, Bart Permentier and Tom Trogh.</p>
                        <p>In education In an educational context, a quiz is usually a form of a student assessment, but often has fewer questions of lessdifficulty and requires less time for completion than a test.This use is typically found in the United States, Canada, the Philippines, Dominican Republic and some colleges in India. For instance, in a mathematics classroom, a quiz may check comprehension of a type of mathematical exercise.Some instructors schedule a daily or weekly quiz ranging from five to thirty relatively easy questions for the purpose of having the students review their previous lessons before attending the next class. A "pop quiz" is a quiz that students are given no time to prepare for; they are simply surprised with it in class</p>
						<p>Other quizzes Additionally, a personality quiz may be a series of multiple-choice questions about the respondent without right or wrong answers. The responses to these questions are tallied according to a key, and the result purports to reveal some quality of the respondent. This kind of "quiz" was originally popularized by women's magazines such as Cosmopolitan.They have since become common on the Internet, where the result page typically includes code which can be added to a blog entry to publicize the result. These postings are common on many sites like LiveJournal.</p>
						<p>The results of online quizzes are generally to be taken lightly, as they do not often reflect the true personality or relationship.They are also rarely psychometrically valid. However, they may occasion reflection on the subject of the quiz and provide a springboard for a person to explore his or her emotions, beliefs, actions or to put some already acquired knowledge to the test.</p>
